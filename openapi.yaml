    # Introduction

    ChatDOC is an SaaS AI product helps you chat with documents, and
    get instant answers with cited sources. It has a set of API with
    which developers can manipulate the documents and questions in the
    system, and build interactive experiences for users outside
    ChatDOC.

    This reference is a comprehensive description of the ChatDOC
    system and its API. In it you'll find details for objects and
    endpoints used in the API. If you feel that something is missing
    or wrong, tell us by filing an issue on
    [Github](https://github.com/chatdoc-com/chatdoc-com.github.io/issues),
    or open a pull request if you know how to fix that, we'll very
    much appreciate your contribution.


    > To interact with ChatDOC using its API, one needs an API
      key. API keys could be created after one subscribes a proper
      membership plan or purchase an API package on
      [ChatDOC.com](https://chatdoc.com/).

    ## Conventions

    The base URL to send all API requests is https://api.chatdoc.com/. HTTPS is required for all API requests.

    The ChatDOC API follows RESTful conventions when possible, with most operations performed via GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. Request and response bodies are encoded as JSON.

    We follow HTTP standards for status codes. For example, a successful request returns a 200 OK response code, and a failed request returns a 4xx or 5xx error code.

    ## JSON conventions

    * Response body of success requests is generally as follows:

        ```json
        {
          "status": "ok",
          "data": {
            "id": 160,
            "name": "Bo",
            ...
          }
        }
        ```

        * `status` and `data` are common properties.
        * Object properties are contained directly in `data`, there is no extra model objects. (e.g. "document", "user", etc.)
    * Property names are in snake_case (not camelCase or kebab-case).
    * Time is stored as [Unix timestamps](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) in seconds, and this point in time technically does not change no matter where you are located on the globe. You can convert it to datetime of your local timezone.
    * Optional properties are nullable, you can just ignore it sometimes.

    ## Request limits

    To ensure a consistent developer experience for all API users, the ChatDOC API is rate limited.

    ## Authentication

    Requests use the HTTP `Authorization` header to both authenticate and authorize operations. The ChatDOC API accepts bearer tokens in this header. Bearer keys can be managed in our web site.

    ```curl
    curl 'https://chatdoc.com/api/v1/external/documents/upload'   -H 'Authorization: Bearer '"$API_KEY"''
    ```

    Different keys of the same user are interoperable of each others' resource, they share common permission of the user.

    # Quick Start
    To use the **ChatDOC API**, you have two options:
    - Directly call the ChatDOC RESTful API from your own service and custom the UI by yourself.
    - Use the `@chatdocai/chatdoc-sdk` to display PDF documents and retrieve data by calling the ChatDOC RESTful API.

      > Before using the API, you need to obtain an API Key from The [https://chatdoc.com/](https://chatdoc.com/)

    You can download [ChatDOC-API-Demo](https://github.com/chatdoc-com/ChatDOC-API-Demo) to start your application.

       > The  server folder is an node server, which request the ChatDOC RESTful API.

       > The  client folder is a vue web app, which use `@chatdocai/chatdoc-sdk` to show the document, and request the node server.

    Here are the steps to start the demo:
    1. run `pnpm install`
    2. Set the env variable **PROXY_API_KEY**.
     > **PROXY_API_KEY**  is the API key that you obtained after purchasing the API package or membership plan.

    3. run `pnpm start`

    By following these steps, you will have a simple ChatDOC API application. If you need more specific information or have any other questions, feel free to ask!




    # ChatDOC Document Viewer
    If you want to view the document in the browser, you can use the `@chatdocai/chatdoc-sdk` npm package.

    The `@chatdocai/chatdoc-sdk` npm package is used to display PDF files and interact with them by selecting text and asking questions. Here are the steps to get started:

    1. **Install `@chatdocai/chatdoc-sdk`**

       ```bash
       pnpm install @chatdocai/chatdoc-sdk
       # npm install @chatdocai/chatdoc-sdk
       # yarn install @chatdocai/chatdoc-sdk
       ```
    2. **Init chatdoc-sdk**

        Initialize the chatdoc-sdk by importing the **initSDK** function from `@chatdocai/chatdoc-sdk` and using it to create an instance of the [PDFViewerSDK](#section/ChatDOC-Document-Viewer/PDFViewerSDK). 

        Provide the mount element the DOM element where you want to mount the SDK, the URL of the PDF file.

        Example

        ```js
        import { initSDK } from '@chatdocai/chatdoc-sdk';

        const sdk = initSDK({
          el: '#pdf-viewer',
          fileUrl: 'https://example.com/pdf-file.pdf',
        })

        ```
    3. **Add event listener**

        Add event listeners to handle specific events. For example, you can listen to the **CHAT_ICON_CLICKED** event to get the selected text from the document when the chat icon is clicked.

        The `@chatdocai/chatdoc-sdk` package also exports the EVENT_TYPES object, which types the event name. [**here**](#section/SDK-API/Global) is the event types info

        Example
        ```js
        import { EVENT_TYPES } from '@chatdocai/chatdoc-sdk';

        // this event is dispatched after you clicked the chat icon in document
        sdk.on(EVENT_TYPES.CHAT_ICON_CLICKED, (data) => {
          // data is the selected text info from document
          console.log(data)
        });

        ```

    ## PDFViewerSDK
    The PDFViewerSDK class provides a PDF viewer SDK with various methods and properties for interacting with the PDF viewer. Here are some key details about the class:

    # OBJECTS

    ## Document

    You can first upload documents to get started. Supported document formats including pdf, docx/doc, and more formats such as markdown, epub are upcoming.

    ## Collection

    Collection is just a special type of `document`, they have common properties like `name`, `status` etc. The difference is that as for questioning, a document can be standalone or grouped as a `collection`, each file collection is a customized database, and you can acquire knowledge effortlessly through conversation.

    ## Question

    Namely message or chat, there can be [4 Ways to Make Queries](https://chatdoc.notion.site/4-Ways-to-Make-Queries-3d8d6d36060b4c7eb1d69e6a32405dd7):

        Upload a document

        **Params**:

        `collection_id`: if provided, add document to the collection, collection can be created by `POST /collections`

        **Response**:

        * `id`: document id, also called `upload_id`, you can use it to get the document by `GET /documents/{upload_id}`. It's of uuid format.

        **Attention**: you should store `id` in your database, because we don't have a `GET /documents/list` API to list all documents for now.

        * `status`: Once uploaded, the status is `UN_PARSED`, after a series of processing, the
        status would change by time, and finally to be one of the following two cases:

        ```
        UN_PARSED = 1              file uploaded or collection has no document
        ELEMENT_PARSED = 300       analysis of the document has succeeded
        ERROR_STATUSES (< 0)       error occurred during analysis
        ```

        So before the document status finalized, you can poll the status by
        `GET /documents/{upload_id}` at interval of 10s , generally it takes 1-2 minutes to
        finish depending on content length of the document. If error occurred, it doesn't occupy your quota.

        For reference, other statuses are as follows:

        ```
        UN_PARSED = 1              file uploaded or collection has no document
        LINK_UN_PARSED = 10        file link submitted
        PARSING = 12               parsing, mainly used for collection

        ELEMENT_PARSING = 50       element embedding
        INSIGHT_CALLBACK = 70      element parse success
        TEXT_PARSED = 210          text embedding success
        ELEMENT_PARSED = 300       element embedding success

        **Params**:

        * `question`: question to ask

        * `selected_meta`: When use [**Ask About Selected Text**](https://chatdoc.notion.site/4-Ways-to-Make-Queries-3d8d6d36060b4c7eb1d69e6a32405dd7), this field is acquired from [EVENT_TYPES.CHAT_ICON_CLICKED](/api_docs/#section/Getting-started) of our PDFViewerSDK.

        * `history`: chat history, used for [Threaded Chat](https://chatdoc.notion.site/2-Ways-to-Dive-Deeper-1f2e3a8705e744a6872da0d39254f182)
            * this parameter simulates [OpenAI' API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)
            * history is question and answer pairs, which is a list of `ChatMessage` objects, sample parameters are as follows:

            ```json
            [
                {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
                {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."},
                {"role": "user", "content": "Where was it played?"}
                {"role": "assistant", "content": "The 2020 World Series was played at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas."},
            ]
            ```

        * `search_entire_doc`:
            * if true: limit responses to current file' information
            * else: responses go freely with knowledge of our AI

        * `detailed_citation`: Whether to show the source at the end of each sentence or not. Requires enabling the `search_entire_doc` setting.

        * `language`: preferred language of answer to the question, if not provided, we will try to detect the language automatically. But we can't promise, when AI can't answer your question well, it generally answers in English. It's strongly recommended to not specific `language`, which is more flexible and works well.

        **Response**:

        structure is as follows:

        ```json
        {
            "data": {
                "answer": "answer to the question",
                "id": question_id,
                "source_info": [
                    {
                        # key: page number
                        # value: rects
                        '0': [[38.1063, 557.8058, 553.9003, 584.0043]]
                    },
                    {'1': [[38.0, 152.3994, 523.6151, 178.6392]]},
                    {'0': [[38.0, 758.0623, 537.0082, 784.0]]},
                    ...
                ]
            }
        }
        ```

        * `answer`: chunks of answer, may be Markdown format to support rich text, for example: [Tables](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables).
            * If the answer is empty, it means error occurred.

        * `id`: id of the question, you can use it to `GET /questions/{question_id}` later.

        **Attention**: you should store `id` in your database, because we don't have a `GET /questions/list` API to list all questions for now.

        * `source_info`: only responses in the last chunk. Page number may not be ordered, you can use this information to highlight the source of the answer in your PDF viewer, by

            calling [`drawSources`](/#section/ChatDOC-Document-Viewer/PDFViewerSDK) method of our PDFViewerSDK, and converting `source_info` to [`Source`](/#section/ChatDOC-Document-Viewer/PDFViewerSDK) parameter.
